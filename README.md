Book & Notes Vault lets users catalog reading materials or personal notes, monitor total pages read, and tag entries by topic or genre.
All data is stored in the browser (localStorage) â€” no backend required.
You can add, edit, delete, search with regex, import/export JSON, and view real-time statistics.
